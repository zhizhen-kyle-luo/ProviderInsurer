### System Prompt

```
You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: moderate (balance patient care with practice economics, standard care protocols)
- Documentation style: moderate (standard documentation following clinical guidelines, typical detail level)
- Risk tolerance: low (always wait for PA approval before treatment, avoid financial risk)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

ITERATION 1/10


CONFIDENCE SCORE (0.0-1.0):
represents your diagnostic certainty for proposing treatment

0.0-0.3: very uncertain diagnosis
  - need basic diagnostic workup (CBC, basic metabolic panel, vital signs)
  - multiple differentials remain plausible
  - insufficient data to narrow diagnosis

0.3-0.6: working diagnosis forming
  - initial test results available
  - narrowing differential based on objective findings
  - need confirmatory testing to establish diagnosis

0.6-0.9: strong clinical suspicion
  - key diagnostic criteria met
  - may need confirmatory testing (imaging, biopsy, specialized labs)
  - high probability of specific diagnosis but not definitive

0.9-1.0: confident diagnosis
  - diagnostic criteria satisfied per clinical guidelines
  - objective evidence supports diagnosis
  - ready to propose definitive treatment
  - evidence sufficient for treatment PA request

DECISION LOGIC:
- if confidence < 0.9: request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- if confidence >= 0.9: request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

IMPORTANT: generate your own confidence score based on available clinical data

## Interaction 2: Phase 2: Prior Authorization

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-26T00:05:37.395328
**Agent:** Payor
**Action:** Treatment Review

**Metadata:**
- iteration: 1
- request_type: treatment

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

ITERATION 1/10

PROVIDER REQUEST:
Provider Confidence: 0.9
Confidence Rationale: The patient's diagnosis of Crohn's disease with small intestinal stenosis is well-established based on her medical history and current clinical presentation. The 10-day history of abdominal pain aligns with Crohn's disease complications, and the refractory nature of her disease to conventional therapies warrants escalation to biologic treatment. Infliximab is supported by clinical guidelines for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with complications, such as stenosis.
Differential Diagnoses: Crohn's disease-related stenosis, Small intestinal obstruction, Functional abdominal pain


TREATMENT PA REQUEST:
Type: medication
Treatment: Infliximab
Justification: Infliximab is indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional therapy, particularly in the presence of complications such as small intestinal stenosis. The patient has not responded adequately to standard treatments, and biologic therapy is the next appropriate step.
Clinical Evidence: Objective evidence includes the patient's history of Crohn's disease, small intestinal stenosis, and persistent abdominal pain despite prior therapies. Clinical guidelines such as the AGA and ECCO recommend Infliximab for this patient profile.
Guidelines: American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines for Crohn's disease management, European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines on biologic therapy


PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: 60
- Medical History: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia
- Current Diagnoses: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia

TASK: Review PA request and approve/deny based on medical necessity and coverage criteria.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Is treatment medically necessary based on clinical evidence?
- Has step therapy been completed (if applicable)?
- Does request align with clinical guidelines?
- Is documentation sufficient?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "authorization_status": "approved" or "denied",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied, including what's missing or why unnecessary>",
    "criteria_used": "<guidelines or policies applied>",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm" or "Nurse reviewer" or "Medical director"
}
```

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "authorization_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "criteria_used": "American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines and European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines for biologic therapy in Crohn's disease with complications such as small intestinal stenosis. Documentation demonstrates refractory disease to conventional therapies, aligning with clinical necessity for Infliximab.",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm"
}
``` 

### Rationale:
1. **Medical Necessity**: The patient's diagnosis, clinical presentation, and treatment history align with guidelines supporting Infliximab for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with complications.
2. **Step Therapy**: Documentation indicates failure of conventional therapies, meeting step therapy requirements.
3. **Clinical Guidelines Compliance**: Both AGA and ECCO guidelines recommend Infliximab for this patient profile.
4. **Documentation Sufficiency**: Clear evidence of diagnosis, symptom persistence, and treatment history supports the request.

### Cost-Benefit Considerations:
- Approval minimizes risk of appeals and administrative costs if denied.
- Denial could lead to provider frustration or network attrition, which is costlier in the short term.
- Regulatory scrutiny is avoided with guideline adherence.

TASK: Review CLAIM for specialty medication (Phase 3)

CRITICAL CONTEXT: This is Phase 3 - CLAIM ADJUDICATION after treatment already delivered.
The PA was approved in Phase 2, but you can still deny payment if documentation is insufficient.

PATIENT:
- Age: 60
- Medical History: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia

CLAIM SUBMITTED:
- Medication: Infliximab
- Dosage Administered: 5 mg/kg
- Amount Billed: $7950.00

PA APPROVAL RATIONALE (from Phase 2):
American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines and European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines for biologic therapy in Crohn's disease with complications such as small intestinal stenosis. Documentation demonstrates refractory disease to conventional therapies, aligning with clinical necessity for Infliximab.

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
INITIAL PRESENTATION:
Chief Complaint: 10-day history of small intestinal stenosis, abdominal pain
History: 10-day history of small intestinal stenosis, abdominal pain

PROVIDER TREATMENT JUSTIFICATION (from approved PA request):
Diagnostic Confidence: 0.9
Rationale: The patient's diagnosis of Crohn's disease with small intestinal stenosis is well-established based on her medical history and current clinical presentation. The 10-day history of abdominal pain aligns with Crohn's disease complications, and the refractory nature of her disease to conventional therapies warrants escalation to biologic treatment. Infliximab is supported by clinical guidelines for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with complications, such as stenosis.
Differential Diagnoses: Crohn's disease-related stenosis, Small intestinal obstruction, Functional abdominal pain
Treatment Justification: Infliximab is indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional therapy, particularly in the presence of complications such as small intestinal stenosis. The patient has not responded adequately to standard treatments, and biologic therapy is the next appropriate step.
Clinical Evidence: Objective evidence includes the patient's history of Crohn's disease, small intestinal stenosis, and persistent abdominal pain despite prior therapies. Clinical guidelines such as the AGA and ECCO recommend Infliximab for this patient profile.
Guidelines Cited: American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines for Crohn's disease management, European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines on biologic therapy

SERVICE REQUEST RATIONALE:
Moderate-severe CD refractory to conventional therapy...


Your task: Review claim and decide to approve/deny PAYMENT.

Common reasons to deny claim despite PA approval:
- Service/dosing doesn't match PA approval
- Documentation insufficient (missing notes, labs)
- Treatment delivered doesn't match authorized indication
- Billing errors or upcoding

{
    "claim_status": "approved" or "denied" or "partial",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied>",
    "approved_amount": <dollar amount or null>,

{
    "claim_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "approved_amount": 7950.00,

    "requires_additional_documentation": [],
    "reviewer_type": "Claims adjudicator"
}
```  

### Rationale:
1. **Prior Authorization Alignment**: The service provided (Infliximab for Crohn's disease with small intestinal stenosis) matches the prior authorization rationale, which was explicitly guided by AGA and ECCO guidelines.
   
2. **Documentation Review**: Clinical documentation supports the necessity of treatment, including refractory disease to conventional therapies and objective evidence of complications like stenosis and persistent abdominal pain. There are no notable omissions requiring additional documentation.

3. **Billing Accuracy**: No discrepancies were identified between the claim and the prior authorization approval. The dosage (5 mg/kg) aligns with standard practices for Infliximab administration in this patient profile.

4. **Moderate Cost Focus**: Denying this claim post-treatment when it aligns with prior authorization guidelines could lead to provider appeals and administrative costs, as well as potential reputational harm. Approving avoids these risks and aligns with clinical necessity.
