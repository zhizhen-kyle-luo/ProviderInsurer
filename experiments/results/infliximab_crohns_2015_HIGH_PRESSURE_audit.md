### System Prompt

```
You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: high (patient outcomes are primary concern, willing to spend extra time and resources even if less profitable)
- Documentation style: minimal (brief notes covering basic requirements only, faster but higher denial risk)
- Risk tolerance: high (frequently treat before approval, willing to absorb costs if denied)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

ITERATION 1/10


CONFIDENCE SCORE (0.0-1.0):
represents your diagnostic certainty for proposing treatment

0.0-0.3: very uncertain diagnosis
  - need basic diagnostic workup (CBC, basic metabolic panel, vital signs)
  - multiple differentials remain plausible
  - insufficient data to narrow diagnosis

0.3-0.6: working diagnosis forming
  - initial test results available
  - narrowing differential based on objective findings
  - need confirmatory testing to establish diagnosis

0.6-0.9: strong clinical suspicion
  - key diagnostic criteria met
  - may need confirmatory testing (imaging, biopsy, specialized labs)
  - high probability of specific diagnosis but not definitive

0.9-1.0: confident diagnosis
  - diagnostic criteria satisfied per clinical guidelines
  - objective evidence supports diagnosis
  - ready to propose definitive treatment
  - evidence sufficient for treatment PA request

DECISION LOGIC:
- if confidence < 0.9: request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- if confidence >= 0.9: request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

IMPORTANT: generate your own confidence score based on available clinical data





PATIENT INFORMATION:
- Age: 60
- Sex: F
- Chief Complaint: 10-day history of small intestinal stenosis, abdominal pain
- Medical History: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia
- Current Diagnoses: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia

MEDICATION REQUEST (if applicable):
{
  "medication_name": "Infliximab",
  "dosage": "5 mg/kg",
  "icd10_codes": [
    "K50.00",
    "K50.8"
  ],
  "clinical_rationale": "Moderate-severe CD refractory to conventional therapy..."
}

TASK: Based on your current diagnostic confidence, decide your next action:
- If confidence < 0.9: Request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- If confidence >= 0.9: Request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
Update your clinical notes each iteration as you narrow your differential diagnosis. Notes should:
- Integrate new test results and clinical findings
- Document evolving diagnostic reasoning
- Support medical necessity for requested service
- Follow standard H&P format (concise, pertinent findings only)
- For diagnostic test requests: describe diagnoses as "working diagnosis" or "suspected" (provisional)
- For treatment requests: reflect diagnostic certainty based on test results (confirmed diagnosis)

Your notes should justify the requested service based on clinical data.

## Interaction 2: Phase 2: Prior Authorization

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-07T22:37:00.234450
**Agent:** Payor
**Action:** Treatment Review

**Metadata:**
- iteration: 1
- request_type: treatment
- cache_hit: True

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

ITERATION 1/10

PROVIDER REQUEST:

TREATMENT PA REQUEST:
Diagnosis Codes: K50.00 (Crohn's disease of small intestine without complications), K50.8 (Other Crohn's disease)
Treatment: Infliximab infusion, 5 mg/kg (Code: J1745)
Justification: Patient has moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, refractory to conventional therapies, with a history of small intestinal stenosis causing abdominal pain. Infliximab is evidence-based and guideline-recommended for induction and maintenance therapy in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.
Clinical Evidence: The patient has ongoing symptoms of small intestinal stenosis and abdominal pain despite standard therapy. Infliximab is indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, supported by clinical guidelines and trials showing efficacy in reducing inflammation, inducing remission, and preventing complications.
Guidelines: American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guidelines for Crohn's Disease, ECCO (European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation) Guidelines for Crohn's Disease
Clinical Notes: 60-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease diagnosed in 2015, currently presenting with a 10-day history of worsening abdominal pain associated with known small intestinal stenosis. Patient has a history of refractory disease not adequately controlled with conventional therapies, including aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. Current symptoms are consistent with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease activity, with likely ongoing inflammation contributing to stenosis and pain. Physical exam shows mild abdominal tenderness without guarding or rebound. Lab results (if available) pending but expected to show elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR). Given the patient's clinical history, symptomatology, and failure of standard therapies, initiation of infliximab therapy is recommended as per clinical guidelines to reduce inflammation, improve symptoms, and prevent disease progression or complications. Risks and benefits of therapy discussed with the patient.


PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: 60
- Medical History: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia
- Current Diagnoses: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia

TASK: Review PA request and approve/deny based on medical necessity and coverage criteria.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Is treatment medically necessary based on clinical evidence?
- Has step therapy been completed (if applicable)?
- Does request align with clinical guidelines?
- Is documentation sufficient?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "authorization_status": "approved" or "denied",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied, including what's missing or why unnecessary>",
    "criteria_used": "<guidelines or policies applied>",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm" or "Nurse reviewer" or "Medical director"
}
```

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "authorization_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "criteria_used": "American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guidelines for Crohn's Disease, ECCO Guidelines for Crohn's Disease, and coverage policy for infliximab (J1745).",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm"
}
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **Medical Necessity**: The treatment is medically necessary. The patient has moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease that is refractory to conventional therapies, with documented symptoms consistent with active disease and complications (intestinal stenosis, abdominal pain). Infliximab is evidence-based and guideline-recommended for such cases.

2. **Step Therapy**: The patient has completed step therapy, as prior treatments (aminosalicylates and corticosteroids) have failed.

3. **Guidelines Alignment**: The requested treatment aligns with clinical guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology and ECCO.

4. **Sufficient Documentation**: The provider has supplied sufficient clinical documentation to justify the request, including a detailed clinical history and guideline references. Further lab results are pending but are not critical to initiate therapy since the clinical presentation supports the need for treatment.

5. **Cost-Benefit Consideration**: Approving the request avoids potential appeals and ensures compliance with guidelines, reducing the risk of regulatory scrutiny and provider dissatisfaction. Denying this PA could lead to additional administrative burdens and reputational damage if overturned.

## Interaction 4: Phase 3: Claims Adjudication

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-07T22:37:09.998698
**Agent:** Payor
**Action:** Claim Review

**Metadata:**
- service: Infliximab
- pa_type: specialty_medication
- claim_status: approved
- cache_hit: True

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

TASK: Review CLAIM for specialty medication (Phase 3)

CRITICAL CONTEXT: This is Phase 3 - CLAIM ADJUDICATION after treatment already delivered.
The PA was approved in Phase 2, but you can still deny payment if documentation is insufficient.

PATIENT:
- Age: 60
- Medical History: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia

CLAIM SUBMITTED:
- Medication: Infliximab
- Dosage Administered: 5 mg/kg
- Amount Billed: $7950.00

PA APPROVAL RATIONALE (from Phase 2):
American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guidelines for Crohn's Disease, ECCO Guidelines for Crohn's Disease, and coverage policy for infliximab (J1745).

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
INITIAL PRESENTATION:
Chief Complaint: 10-day history of small intestinal stenosis, abdominal pain
History: 10-day history of small intestinal stenosis, abdominal pain

PROVIDER TREATMENT JUSTIFICATION (from approved PA request):
Diagnosis Codes: K50.00 (Crohn's disease of small intestine without complications), K50.8 (Other Crohn's disease)
Treatment Justification: Patient has moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, refractory to conventional therapies, with a history of small intestinal stenosis causing abdominal pain. Infliximab is evidence-based and guideline-recommended for induction and maintenance therapy in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.
Clinical Evidence: The patient has ongoing symptoms of small intestinal stenosis and abdominal pain despite standard therapy. Infliximab is indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, supported by clinical guidelines and trials showing efficacy in reducing inflammation, inducing remission, and preventing complications.
Guidelines Cited: American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guidelines for Crohn's Disease, ECCO (European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation) Guidelines for Crohn's Disease
Clinical Notes: 60-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease diagnosed in 2015, currently presenting with a 10-day history of worsening abdominal pain associated with known small intestinal stenosis. Patient has a history of refractory disease not adequately controlled with conventional therapies, including aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. Current symptoms are consistent with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease activity, with likely ongoing inflammation contributing to stenosis and pain. Physical exam shows mild abdominal tenderness without guarding or rebound. Lab results (if available) pending but expected to show elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR). Given the patient's clinical history, symptomatology, and failure of standard therapies, initiation of infliximab therapy is recommended as per clinical guidelines to reduce inflammation, improve symptoms, and prevent disease progression or complications. Risks and benefits of therapy discussed with the patient.

SERVICE REQUEST RATIONALE:
Moderate-severe CD refractory to conventional therapy...


Your task: Review claim and decide to approve/deny PAYMENT.

Common reasons to deny claim despite PA approval:
- Service/dosing doesn't match PA approval
- Documentation insufficient (missing notes, labs)
- Treatment delivered doesn't match authorized indication
- Billing errors or upcoding

### LLM Response

```
Based on the provided information, I will evaluate whether the claim aligns with the prior authorization (PA) approval and whether documentation supports the payment. Let’s review the critical points:

1. **PA Approval**:  
   - The PA approval was granted based on clinical guidelines (American College of Gastroenterology and ECCO Guidelines for Crohn's Disease).  
   - Approved for infliximab for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, refractory to conventional therapies.  
   - Dosage and indication were consistent with guidelines.  

2. **Claim Details**:  
   - Medication: Infliximab.  
   - Dosage: 5 mg/kg aligns with standard dosing for Crohn's disease.  
   - Amount Billed: $7,950.00.  

3. **Clinical Documentation Review**:  
   - The clinical notes provided confirm the diagnosis of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease.  
   - The patient has a history of refractory disease, small intestinal stenosis, and abdominal pain.  
   - Justification for infliximab treatment was provided and aligns with clinical guidelines.  
   - Supporting lab results (e.g., CRP, ESR) were mentioned as pending but not included in the documentation.  

4. **Potential Denial Reasons**:  
   - Missing lab results could be seen as insufficient documentation to confirm ongoing inflammation.  
   - However, the PA was approved based on clinical guidelines and documented symptoms, and denying payment solely for missing labs could lead to provider frustration or appeal.  
   - Dosage, indication, and service match the PA approval, so denial based on these criteria is not justified.  

5. **Strategic Consideration**:  
   - Denial at this stage risks provider appeal, creating administrative costs.  
   - The PA approval creates an expectation of payment unless a clear violation of guidelines or documentation insufficiency exists.  

### Final Decision:

```json
{
    "claim_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "approved_amount": 7950.00,
    "criteria_used": "American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guidelines for Crohn's Disease, ECCO Guidelines for Crohn's Disease; prior authorization approval; consistent dosing for infliximab (5 mg/kg).",
    "requires_additional_documentation": [],
    "reviewer_type": "Claims adjudicator"
}
```

### Rationale:
- The treatment matches the PA approval in terms of indication, dosage, and guideline adherence.  
- Denying the claim for missing lab results is not justified, as the PA was already approved based on clinical documentation and guidelines.  
- Approving the claim avoids unnecessary appeals and maintains positive provider relations, balancing cost control with administrative burden and network stability.  

```
