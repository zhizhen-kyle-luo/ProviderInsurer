### System Prompt

```
You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: moderate (balance patient care with practice economics, standard care protocols)
- Documentation style: defensive (extensive documentation anticipating potential denials, includes extra justification and guideline references)
- Risk tolerance: moderate (treat urgent cases without approval then appeal later, calculated risk-taking)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

ITERATION 1/10


CONFIDENCE SCORE (0.0-1.0):
represents your diagnostic certainty for proposing treatment

0.0-0.3: very uncertain diagnosis
  - need basic diagnostic workup (CBC, basic metabolic panel, vital signs)
  - multiple differentials remain plausible
  - insufficient data to narrow diagnosis

0.3-0.6: working diagnosis forming
  - initial test results available
  - narrowing differential based on objective findings
  - need confirmatory testing to establish diagnosis

0.6-0.9: strong clinical suspicion
  - key diagnostic criteria met
  - may need confirmatory testing (imaging, biopsy, specialized labs)
  - high probability of specific diagnosis but not definitive

0.9-1.0: confident diagnosis
  - diagnostic criteria satisfied per clinical guidelines
  - objective evidence supports diagnosis
  - ready to propose definitive treatment
  - evidence sufficient for treatment PA request

DECISION LOGIC:
- if confidence < 0.9: request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- if confidence >= 0.9: request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

IMPORTANT: generate your own confidence score based on available clinical data

**Action:** Treatment Review

**Metadata:**

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

ITERATION 1/10

PROVIDER REQUEST:
Provider Confidence: 0.95
Confidence Rationale: The patient has a well-documented history of ileal Crohn's disease with prior ileocecal resection and recurrent subocclusive episodes. She has failed Azathioprine maintenance therapy, and endoscopic recurrence with stenosis has been documented. The patient's high-risk phenotype aligns with clinical guidelines recommending combination therapy of Infliximab and Azathioprine. Diagnostic criteria are satisfied, and objective evidence supports the diagnosis and treatment plan.
Differential Diagnoses: Ileal Crohn's disease with stenosis, Adhesive small bowel obstruction


TREATMENT PA REQUEST:
Type: medication
Treatment: Infliximab
Justification: Infliximab is indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with high-risk features, including endoscopic recurrence and stenosis, especially following failure of Azathioprine. Studies demonstrate efficacy in reducing inflammation and preventing complications. Combination therapy with Azathioprine is recommended in high-risk patients per AGA guidelines.
Clinical Evidence: Patient has failed Azathioprine maintenance therapy. Endoscopic recurrence and stenosis documented. High-risk phenotype necessitates escalation of care to biologic therapy. Infliximab is FDA-approved for Crohn's disease management in this context.
Guidelines: American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Guidelines on Crohn's Disease Management, FDA prescribing information for Infliximab


PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: 64
- Medical History: Ileal Crohn's disease (diagnosed >20 years ago), History of ileocecal resection (2004), Arterial hypertension, Recurrent subocclusive episodes
- Current Diagnoses: Ileal Crohn's disease (diagnosed >20 years ago), History of ileocecal resection (2004), Arterial hypertension, Recurrent subocclusive episodes

TASK: Review PA request and approve/deny based on medical necessity and coverage criteria.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Is treatment medically necessary based on clinical evidence?
- Has step therapy been completed (if applicable)?
- Does request align with clinical guidelines?
- Is documentation sufficient?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "authorization_status": "approved" or "denied",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied, including what's missing or why unnecessary>",
    "criteria_used": "<guidelines or policies applied>",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm" or "Nurse reviewer" or "Medical director"
}
```

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "authorization_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "criteria_used": "American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Guidelines on Crohn's Disease Management; FDA prescribing information for Infliximab; Documentation of step therapy failure (Azathioprine), endoscopic recurrence, and stenosis.",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm"
}
``` 

### Rationale:
1. **Medical necessity**: The clinical evidence provided demonstrates that Infliximab is medically necessary for this patient. The patient has failed step therapy with Azathioprine, has documented endoscopic recurrence and stenosis, and exhibits a high-risk phenotype necessitating escalation to biologic therapy.
   
2. **Alignment with guidelines**: The request aligns with AGA guidelines recommending combination therapy with Infliximab and Azathioprine for high-risk Crohn's disease patients. FDA prescribing information also supports the use of Infliximab for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease management.

3. **Documentation**: Sufficient documentation has been provided to justify the treatment, including objective evidence of disease progression, prior treatment failure, and clinical rationale.

4. **Cost focus**: While Infliximab is expensive, approving the request avoids potential appeals and administrative burden, and aligns with clinical guidelines, minimizing regulatory and reputational risks.

Given the high confidence in the provider's rationale and adherence to guidelines, denying this request would likely lead to appeals and potential network dissatisfaction, outweighing short-term cost savings.

### Reasoning:
1. **Service matches PA approval**:
   - Dosage administered (5 mg/kg) aligns with FDA prescribing information and AGA guidelines.
   - The indication for treatment (moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with high-risk features such as stenosis and step therapy failure) matches the rationale provided during PA approval.

2. **Documentation is sufficient**:
   - Clinical notes detail the patient's history, diagnostic findings, and justification for escalation of care to biologic therapy.
   - Endoscopic recurrence and stenosis are documented, supporting medical necessity.

3. **Billing appears accurate**:
   - Amount billed ($7,950.00) is within the expected range for Infliximab administration at the prescribed dosage.

4. **No grounds for denial**:
   - No discrepancies between the service provided and the approved authorization.
   - Documentation supports the medical necessity of the treatment delivered.

5. **Cost focus**:
   - Denying the claim retrospectively would likely result in an appeal, which incurs administrative costs and risks provider frustration or network departure.
   - Approving the claim avoids these downstream costs and maintains network stability.

### Decision:
The claim is **approved** in full, as it meets the criteria established during prior authorization and aligns with guidelines and medical necessity.
