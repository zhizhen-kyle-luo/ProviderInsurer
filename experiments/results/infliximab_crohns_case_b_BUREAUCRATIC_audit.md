### System Prompt

```
You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: high (patient outcomes are primary concern, willing to spend extra time and resources even if less profitable)
- Documentation style: defensive (extensive documentation anticipating potential denials, includes extra justification and guideline references)
- Risk tolerance: low (always wait for PA approval before treatment, avoid financial risk)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

ITERATION 1/10


CONFIDENCE SCORE (0.0-1.0):
represents your diagnostic certainty for proposing treatment

0.0-0.3: very uncertain diagnosis
  - need basic diagnostic workup (CBC, basic metabolic panel, vital signs)
  - multiple differentials remain plausible
  - insufficient data to narrow diagnosis

0.3-0.6: working diagnosis forming
  - initial test results available
  - narrowing differential based on objective findings
  - need confirmatory testing to establish diagnosis

0.6-0.9: strong clinical suspicion
  - key diagnostic criteria met
  - may need confirmatory testing (imaging, biopsy, specialized labs)
  - high probability of specific diagnosis but not definitive

0.9-1.0: confident diagnosis
  - diagnostic criteria satisfied per clinical guidelines
  - objective evidence supports diagnosis
  - ready to propose definitive treatment
  - evidence sufficient for treatment PA request

DECISION LOGIC:
- if confidence < 0.9: request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- if confidence >= 0.9: request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

IMPORTANT: generate your own confidence score based on available clinical data





PATIENT INFORMATION:
- Age: 64
- Sex: F
- Chief Complaint: Recurrent abdominal pain and obstructive symptoms
- Medical History: Ileal Crohn's disease (diagnosed >20 years ago), History of ileocecal resection (2004), Arterial hypertension, Recurrent subocclusive episodes
- Current Diagnoses: Ileal Crohn's disease (diagnosed >20 years ago), History of ileocecal resection (2004), Arterial hypertension, Recurrent subocclusive episodes

MEDICATION REQUEST (if applicable):
{
  "medication_name": "Infliximab",
  "dosage": "5 mg/kg",
  "frequency": "Weeks 0, 2, 6 then every 8 weeks",
  "duration": "12 months",

  "prior_therapies_failed": [
    "Azathioprine (maintenance failure)"
  ],
  "step_therapy_completed": true
}

TASK: Based on your current diagnostic confidence, decide your next action:
- If confidence < 0.9: Request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- If confidence >= 0.9: Request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
Update your clinical notes each iteration as you narrow your differential diagnosis. Notes should:
- Integrate new test results and clinical findings
- Document evolving diagnostic reasoning
- Support medical necessity for requested service
- Follow standard H&P format (concise, pertinent findings only)
- For diagnostic test requests: describe diagnoses as "working diagnosis" or "suspected" (provisional)
- For treatment requests: reflect diagnostic certainty based on test results (confirmed diagnosis)

Your notes should justify the requested service based on clinical data.

## Interaction 2: Phase 2: Prior Authorization

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-07T22:37:48.279314
**Agent:** Payor
**Action:** Treatment Review

**Metadata:**
- iteration: 1
- request_type: treatment
- cache_hit: True

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

ITERATION 1/10

PROVIDER REQUEST:

TREATMENT PA REQUEST:
Diagnosis Codes: K50.012 (Crohn's disease of small intestine with intestinal obstruction), K56.60 (Unspecified intestinal obstruction)
Treatment: Infliximab infusion (Code: J1745)
Justification: The patient has a high-risk phenotype of Crohn's disease with documented failure of maintenance therapy using Azathioprine and endoscopic evidence of recurrence with stenosis. Combination therapy with Infliximab and Azathioprine is recommended per clinical guidelines to reduce recurrence, prevent progression, and improve outcomes in patients with complicated Crohn's disease.
Clinical Evidence: Objective findings include documentation of ileal Crohn's disease recurrence with stenosis, history of subocclusive episodes, and failure of prior maintenance therapy. Endoscopic findings confirm recurrence. Infliximab therapy has demonstrated efficacy in reducing inflammation and maintaining remission in high-risk Crohn's disease patients.
Guidelines: American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2021 guidelines for the management of Crohn's disease, ECCO guidelines for Crohn's disease management 2020
Clinical Notes: 64-year-old female with a longstanding history of ileal Crohn's disease and history of ileocecal resection in 2004 presents with recurrent subocclusive episodes and abdominal pain. Her Crohn's disease has been refractory to Azathioprine maintenance therapy, with documented endoscopic recurrence and ileal stenosis. Current management includes dietary modifications and symptomatic treatment, but she remains high-risk due to obstructive symptoms and disease recurrence. Based on clinical guidelines and her phenotype, combination therapy with Infliximab and Azathioprine is indicated to prevent disease progression and improve patient outcomes. Treatment is requested with Infliximab at 5 mg/kg administered as an induction (weeks 0, 2, and 6) followed by maintenance every 8 weeks for 12 months.


PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: 64
- Medical History: Ileal Crohn's disease (diagnosed >20 years ago), History of ileocecal resection (2004), Arterial hypertension, Recurrent subocclusive episodes
- Current Diagnoses: Ileal Crohn's disease (diagnosed >20 years ago), History of ileocecal resection (2004), Arterial hypertension, Recurrent subocclusive episodes

TASK: Review PA request and approve/deny based on medical necessity and coverage criteria.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Is treatment medically necessary based on clinical evidence?
- Has step therapy been completed (if applicable)?
- Does request align with clinical guidelines?
- Is documentation sufficient?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "authorization_status": "approved" or "denied",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied, including what's missing or why unnecessary>",
    "criteria_used": "<guidelines or policies applied>",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm" or "Nurse reviewer" or "Medical director"
}
```

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "authorization_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "criteria_used": "American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2021 guidelines for the management of Crohn's disease, ECCO guidelines for Crohn's disease management 2020, and clinical documentation provided (failure of prior maintenance therapy, endoscopic evidence of recurrence, high-risk phenotype, and stenosis).",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm"
}
``` 

### Rationale:
1. **Medical Necessity**: The treatment is medically necessary as the patient has a high-risk phenotype of Crohn's disease, documented failure of Azathioprine maintenance therapy, and endoscopic evidence of recurrence with stenosis. These factors indicate the patient is at significant risk of disease progression.

2. **Step Therapy**: The patient has already failed step therapy with Azathioprine, a standard first-line maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease.

3. **Guidelines Compliance**: The request aligns with AGA 2021 and ECCO 2020 guidelines, which recommend combination therapy with Infliximab and Azathioprine for high-risk Crohn's disease patients to prevent progression and maintain remission.

4. **Documentation Sufficiency**: The provider has submitted detailed clinical evidence, including endoscopic findings, recurrence history, and prior treatment failure, supporting the need for Infliximab therapy.

5. **Cost-Benefit Consideration**: While Infliximab is costly, denying the treatment could lead to further disease progression, increased hospitalizations, or surgical interventions, which may result in even higher costs in the short term.

### Decision:
Given the strong alignment with clinical guidelines, sufficient documentation, and moderate cost focus, approving the PA request is the optimal decision.

You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: moderate (balance patient care with practice economics, standard care protocols)
- Documentation style: moderate (standard documentation following clinical guidelines, typical detail level)
- Risk tolerance: moderate (treat urgent cases without approval then appeal later, calculated risk-taking)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

## Interaction 4: Phase 3: Claims Adjudication

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-07T22:37:53.389623
**Agent:** Payor
**Action:** Claim Review

**Metadata:**
- service: Infliximab
- pa_type: specialty_medication
- claim_status: approved
- cache_hit: True

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

TASK: Review CLAIM for specialty medication (Phase 3)

CRITICAL CONTEXT: This is Phase 3 - CLAIM ADJUDICATION after treatment already delivered.
The PA was approved in Phase 2, but you can still deny payment if documentation is insufficient.

PATIENT:
- Age: 64
- Medical History: Ileal Crohn's disease (diagnosed >20 years ago), History of ileocecal resection (2004), Arterial hypertension, Recurrent subocclusive episodes

CLAIM SUBMITTED:
- Medication: Infliximab
- Dosage Administered: 5 mg/kg
- Amount Billed: $7950.00

PA APPROVAL RATIONALE (from Phase 2):
American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2021 guidelines for the management of Crohn's disease, ECCO guidelines for Crohn's disease management 2020, and clinical documentation provided (failure of prior maintenance therapy, endoscopic evidence of recurrence, high-risk phenotype, and stenosis).

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
INITIAL PRESENTATION:
Chief Complaint: Recurrent abdominal pain and obstructive symptoms
History: Long-standing Crohn's disease with recent recurrence of obstructive symptoms. Colonoscopy reveals inflammatory stenosis at anastomosis site.
Physical Exam: Long-standing Crohn's disease with recent recurrence of obstructive symptoms. Colonoscopy reveals inflammatory stenosis at anastomosis site.

PROVIDER TREATMENT JUSTIFICATION (from approved PA request):
Diagnosis Codes: K50.012 (Crohn's disease of small intestine with intestinal obstruction), K56.60 (Unspecified intestinal obstruction)
Treatment Justification: The patient has a high-risk phenotype of Crohn's disease with documented failure of maintenance therapy using Azathioprine and endoscopic evidence of recurrence with stenosis. Combination therapy with Infliximab and Azathioprine is recommended per clinical guidelines to reduce recurrence, prevent progression, and improve outcomes in patients with complicated Crohn's disease.
Clinical Evidence: Objective findings include documentation of ileal Crohn's disease recurrence with stenosis, history of subocclusive episodes, and failure of prior maintenance therapy. Endoscopic findings confirm recurrence. Infliximab therapy has demonstrated efficacy in reducing inflammation and maintaining remission in high-risk Crohn's disease patients.
Guidelines Cited: American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2021 guidelines for the management of Crohn's disease, ECCO guidelines for Crohn's disease management 2020
Clinical Notes: 64-year-old female with a longstanding history of ileal Crohn's disease and history of ileocecal resection in 2004 presents with recurrent subocclusive episodes and abdominal pain. Her Crohn's disease has been refractory to Azathioprine maintenance therapy, with documented endoscopic recurrence and ileal stenosis. Current management includes dietary modifications and symptomatic treatment, but she remains high-risk due to obstructive symptoms and disease recurrence. Based on clinical guidelines and her phenotype, combination therapy with Infliximab and Azathioprine is indicated to prevent disease progression and improve patient outcomes. Treatment is requested with Infliximab at 5 mg/kg administered as an induction (weeks 0, 2, and 6) followed by maintenance every 8 weeks for 12 months.

SERVICE REQUEST RATIONALE:
Patient has failed maintenance therapy with Azathioprine. documented endoscopic recurrence with stenosis. Combination therapy (Infliximab + Azathioprine) indicated for high-risk phenotype.


Your task: Review claim and decide to approve/deny PAYMENT.

Common reasons to deny claim despite PA approval:
- Service/dosing doesn't match PA approval
- Documentation insufficient (missing notes, labs)
- Treatment delivered doesn't match authorized indication
- Billing errors or upcoding

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "claim_status": "approved" or "denied" or "partial",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied>",
    "approved_amount": <dollar amount or null>,
    "criteria_used": "<billing guidelines>",
    "requires_additional_documentation": ["<item1>", ...],
    "reviewer_type": "Claims adjudicator" or "Medical reviewer"

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "claim_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "approved_amount": 7950.00,
    "criteria_used": "American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2021 guidelines, ECCO guidelines for Crohn's disease management 2020, prior authorization approval documentation",
    "requires_additional_documentation": [],
    "reviewer_type": "Claims adjudicator"
}
```

### Rationale:
1. **PA Approval Alignment**: The treatment (Infliximab at 5 mg/kg) aligns with the prior authorization approval based on AGA and ECCO guidelines. The dosage and service match the originally approved request.

2. **Clinical Documentation**: The provider has submitted sufficient clinical documentation, including:
   - Endoscopic evidence of recurrence.
   - History of refractory Crohn's disease with failure of Azathioprine maintenance therapy.
   - High-risk phenotype (stenosis, subocclusive episodes).

3. **Billing Accuracy**: There is no evidence of billing errors or upcoding. The dosage billed (5 mg/kg) matches the approved treatment plan.

4. **Guideline Compliance**: The treatment is consistent with established guidelines for high-risk Crohn's disease patients, and the clinical justification provided supports its medical necessity.

5. **Avoid Administrative Escalation**: Denying this claim, despite PA approval and clear documentation, risks an appeal, which would incur additional administrative costs and provider frustration.

### Cost-Benefit Consideration:
- While denying the claim could potentially save immediate costs, the PA approval and strong clinical documentation make this denial likely to be overturned upon appeal.
- Approving the claim minimizes regulatory risks, avoids provider dissatisfaction, and ensures adherence to the prior authorization process.
