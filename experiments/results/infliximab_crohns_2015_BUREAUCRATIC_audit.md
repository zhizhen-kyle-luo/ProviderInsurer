### System Prompt

```
You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: high (patient outcomes are primary concern, willing to spend extra time and resources even if less profitable)
- Documentation style: defensive (extensive documentation anticipating potential denials, includes extra justification and guideline references)
- Risk tolerance: low (always wait for PA approval before treatment, avoid financial risk)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

ITERATION 1/10


CONFIDENCE SCORE (0.0-1.0):
represents your diagnostic certainty for proposing treatment

0.0-0.3: very uncertain diagnosis
  - need basic diagnostic workup (CBC, basic metabolic panel, vital signs)
  - multiple differentials remain plausible
  - insufficient data to narrow diagnosis

0.3-0.6: working diagnosis forming
  - initial test results available
  - narrowing differential based on objective findings
  - need confirmatory testing to establish diagnosis

0.6-0.9: strong clinical suspicion
  - key diagnostic criteria met
  - may need confirmatory testing (imaging, biopsy, specialized labs)
  - high probability of specific diagnosis but not definitive

0.9-1.0: confident diagnosis
  - diagnostic criteria satisfied per clinical guidelines
  - objective evidence supports diagnosis
  - ready to propose definitive treatment
  - evidence sufficient for treatment PA request

DECISION LOGIC:
- if confidence < 0.9: request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- if confidence >= 0.9: request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

IMPORTANT: generate your own confidence score based on available clinical data





PATIENT INFORMATION:
- Age: 60
- Sex: F
- Chief Complaint: 10-day history of small intestinal stenosis, abdominal pain
- Medical History: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia
- Current Diagnoses: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia

  "icd10_codes": [
    "K50.00",
    "K50.8"
  ],
  "clinical_rationale": "Moderate-severe CD refractory to conventional therapy..."
}

TASK: Based on your current diagnostic confidence, decide your next action:
- If confidence < 0.9: Request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- If confidence >= 0.9: Request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
Update your clinical notes each iteration as you narrow your differential diagnosis. Notes should:
- Integrate new test results and clinical findings
- Document evolving diagnostic reasoning
- Support medical necessity for requested service
- Follow standard H&P format (concise, pertinent findings only)
- For diagnostic test requests: describe diagnoses as "working diagnosis" or "suspected" (provisional)
- For treatment requests: reflect diagnostic certainty based on test results (confirmed diagnosis)

Your notes should justify the requested service based on clinical data.

## Interaction 2: Phase 2: Prior Authorization

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-07T22:37:15.999654
**Agent:** Payor
**Action:** Treatment Review

**Metadata:**
- iteration: 1
- request_type: treatment
- cache_hit: True

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

ITERATION 1/10

PROVIDER REQUEST:

TREATMENT PA REQUEST:
Diagnosis Codes: K50.00 (Crohn's disease of small intestine without complications), K50.8 (Other Crohn's disease), K56.2 (Intestinal obstruction due to stricture of intestine)
Treatment: Infliximab infusion (Code: J1745)
Justification: Infliximab is indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional treatment, including aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease with complications such as small intestinal stenosis causing significant abdominal pain. Current symptoms suggest active inflammation and progression of disease.
Clinical Evidence: Objective findings include 10-day history of abdominal pain and confirmed intestinal stenosis. Patient previously failed conventional therapy. Infliximab is supported by clinical guidelines for use in refractory Crohn's disease. This treatment is expected to reduce inflammation, prevent progression, and improve symptoms.
Guidelines: American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Guidelines for Crohn's Disease Management, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Crohn's Disease Guidelines
Clinical Notes: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 60-year-old female with known Crohn's disease (diagnosed in 2015) presenting with a 10-day history of worsening abdominal pain. Pain is localized to the mid-abdomen and associated with nausea. No vomiting, fever, or changes in bowel habits reported. Symptoms are consistent with small intestinal stenosis, previously confirmed as a complication of Crohn's disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Crohn's disease (diagnosed in 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS: Patient has failed prior conventional therapy for Crohn's disease, including corticosteroids and aminosalicylates.

ASSESSMENT: Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with complications (intestinal stenosis). Clinical symptoms and history align with active disease progression requiring escalation of care.

PLAN: Request prior authorization for infliximab infusion (5 mg/kg). Infliximab is indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional therapy. Supported by guidelines from AGA and NICE, infliximab is expected to reduce inflammation and prevent further complications. Extensive clinical documentation provided to ensure medical necessity is established.


PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: 60
- Medical History: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia
- Current Diagnoses: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia

TASK: Review PA request and approve/deny based on medical necessity and coverage criteria.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Is treatment medically necessary based on clinical evidence?
- Has step therapy been completed (if applicable)?
- Does request align with clinical guidelines?
- Is documentation sufficient?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "authorization_status": "approved" or "denied",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied, including what's missing or why unnecessary>",
    "criteria_used": "<guidelines or policies applied>",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm" or "Nurse reviewer" or "Medical director"
}
```

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "authorization_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "criteria_used": "American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Guidelines for Crohn's Disease Management, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Crohn's Disease Guidelines",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm"
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Medical Necessity**: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with complications (intestinal stenosis). Clinical evidence, including a history of failed conventional therapy and documented progression of disease, supports the need for infliximab infusion.
- **Step Therapy**: The patient has previously failed conventional treatments such as corticosteroids and aminosalicylates, satisfying step therapy requirements.
- **Guidelines Alignment**: Both AGA and NICE guidelines recommend infliximab as a treatment for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to standard therapies.
- **Documentation Sufficiency**: The provider has submitted comprehensive clinical notes, including history, objective findings, and justification for the proposed treatment. Medical necessity is clearly established.
- **Cost Management**: While infliximab is an expensive treatment, denying it may lead to disease progression, potential hospitalizations, and increased costs in the near term. Approving aligns with guidelines and avoids provider dissatisfaction or regulatory scrutiny.

## Interaction 4: Phase 3: Claims Adjudication

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-07T22:37:22.666886
**Agent:** Payor
**Action:** Claim Review

**Metadata:**
- service: Infliximab
- pa_type: specialty_medication
- claim_status: approved
- cache_hit: True

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

TASK: Review CLAIM for specialty medication (Phase 3)

CRITICAL CONTEXT: This is Phase 3 - CLAIM ADJUDICATION after treatment already delivered.
The PA was approved in Phase 2, but you can still deny payment if documentation is insufficient.

PATIENT:
- Age: 60
- Medical History: Crohn's disease (diagnosed 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia

CLAIM SUBMITTED:
- Medication: Infliximab
- Dosage Administered: 5 mg/kg
- Amount Billed: $7950.00

PA APPROVAL RATIONALE (from Phase 2):
American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Guidelines for Crohn's Disease Management, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Crohn's Disease Guidelines

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
INITIAL PRESENTATION:
Chief Complaint: 10-day history of small intestinal stenosis, abdominal pain
History: 10-day history of small intestinal stenosis, abdominal pain

PROVIDER TREATMENT JUSTIFICATION (from approved PA request):
Diagnosis Codes: K50.00 (Crohn's disease of small intestine without complications), K50.8 (Other Crohn's disease), K56.2 (Intestinal obstruction due to stricture of intestine)
Treatment Justification: Infliximab is indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional treatment, including aminosalicylates and corticosteroids. The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn's disease with complications such as small intestinal stenosis causing significant abdominal pain. Current symptoms suggest active inflammation and progression of disease.
Clinical Evidence: Objective findings include 10-day history of abdominal pain and confirmed intestinal stenosis. Patient previously failed conventional therapy. Infliximab is supported by clinical guidelines for use in refractory Crohn's disease. This treatment is expected to reduce inflammation, prevent progression, and improve symptoms.
Guidelines Cited: American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Guidelines for Crohn's Disease Management, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Crohn's Disease Guidelines
Clinical Notes: HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 60-year-old female with known Crohn's disease (diagnosed in 2015) presenting with a 10-day history of worsening abdominal pain. Pain is localized to the mid-abdomen and associated with nausea. No vomiting, fever, or changes in bowel habits reported. Symptoms are consistent with small intestinal stenosis, previously confirmed as a complication of Crohn's disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Crohn's disease (diagnosed in 2015), Small intestinal stenosis, Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS: Patient has failed prior conventional therapy for Crohn's disease, including corticosteroids and aminosalicylates.

ASSESSMENT: Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with complications (intestinal stenosis). Clinical symptoms and history align with active disease progression requiring escalation of care.

PLAN: Request prior authorization for infliximab infusion (5 mg/kg). Infliximab is indicated for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional therapy. Supported by guidelines from AGA and NICE, infliximab is expected to reduce inflammation and prevent further complications. Extensive clinical documentation provided to ensure medical necessity is established.

SERVICE REQUEST RATIONALE:
Moderate-severe CD refractory to conventional therapy...


Your task: Review claim and decide to approve/deny PAYMENT.

Common reasons to deny claim despite PA approval:
- Service/dosing doesn't match PA approval
- Documentation insufficient (missing notes, labs)
- Treatment delivered doesn't match authorized indication
- Billing errors or upcoding

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "claim_status": "approved" or "denied" or "partial",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied>",
    "approved_amount": <dollar amount or null>,
    "criteria_used": "<billing guidelines>",
    "requires_additional_documentation": ["<item1>", ...],
    "reviewer_type": "Claims adjudicator" or "Medical reviewer"
}

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "claim_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "approved_amount": 7950.00,
    "criteria_used": "Billing guidelines aligned with AGA and NICE guidelines for Crohn's Disease management. Documentation confirms medical necessity and adherence to prior authorization approval.",
    "requires_additional_documentation": [],
    "reviewer_type": "Claims adjudicator"
}
``` 

### Rationale:
1. **PA Approval Alignment**: The service delivered (Infliximab, 5 mg/kg) matches the prior authorization approval for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional therapy as per AGA and NICE guidelines.
2. **Sufficient Documentation**: Clinical documentation provided, including history of present illness, diagnosis codes, and treatment justification, clearly establishes medical necessity for this treatment and dosage.
3. **No Billing Errors**: The dosage and amount billed appear consistent with the approved treatment plan and standard costs for Infliximab infusion.
4. **Short-Term Cost Control**: Denying this claim without clear grounds would likely result in a successful appeal, increasing administrative costs and risking provider dissatisfaction.
5. **Regulatory and Reputation Risks**: Denying a claim with sufficient documentation and approved prior authorization would introduce risk of regulatory scrutiny and provider network destabilization.

Adjudicating this claim as "approved" minimizes administrative burden, adheres to guidelines, and avoids unnecessary provider friction.
