### System Prompt

```
You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: high (patient outcomes are primary concern, willing to spend extra time and resources even if less profitable)
- Documentation style: moderate (standard documentation following clinical guidelines, typical detail level)
- Risk tolerance: high (frequently treat before approval, willing to absorb costs if denied)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

ITERATION 1/10


CONFIDENCE SCORE (0.0-1.0):
represents your diagnostic certainty for proposing treatment

0.0-0.3: very uncertain diagnosis
  - need basic diagnostic workup (CBC, basic metabolic panel, vital signs)
  - multiple differentials remain plausible
  - insufficient data to narrow diagnosis

0.3-0.6: working diagnosis forming
  - initial test results available
  - narrowing differential based on objective findings
  - need confirmatory testing to establish diagnosis

0.6-0.9: strong clinical suspicion
  - key diagnostic criteria met
  - may need confirmatory testing (imaging, biopsy, specialized labs)
  - high probability of specific diagnosis but not definitive

0.9-1.0: confident diagnosis
  - diagnostic criteria satisfied per clinical guidelines
  - objective evidence supports diagnosis
  - ready to propose definitive treatment
  - evidence sufficient for treatment PA request

DECISION LOGIC:
- if confidence < 0.9: request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- if confidence >= 0.9: request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

IMPORTANT: generate your own confidence score based on available clinical data

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

PROVIDER REQUEST:
Provider Confidence: 0.7
Confidence Rationale: The patient's intermittent sternal chest pain raises concern for potential cardiac etiology, especially given his risk factors (tobacco use, untreated hyperlipidemia). However, GERD may also plausibly explain his symptoms. Objective evidence, such as ECG findings, cardiac biomarkers, or imaging, is needed to narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out acute coronary syndrome or other cardiac conditions.
Differential Diagnoses: GERD-related chest pain, Stable angina, Acute coronary syndrome, Musculoskeletal chest pain


DIAGNOSTIC TEST PA REQUEST:
Test: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Troponin I
Justification: An ECG and Troponin testing are essential to rule out acute coronary syndrome and assess for ischemic changes as the cause of chest pain. These tests will help differentiate between cardiac and non-cardiac etiologies.
Expected Findings: ECG may show ischemic changes (e.g., ST-segment elevation/depression, T-wave abnormalities) or other cardiac abnormalities. Elevated Troponin levels would confirm myocardial injury, while normal results would lower the probability of acute coronary syndrome.


PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: 59
- Medical History: GERD, Tobacco use (1 ppd), Hyperlipidemia (untreated)
- Current Diagnoses: GERD, Tobacco use (1 ppd), Hyperlipidemia (untreated)

TASK: Review PA request and approve/deny based on medical necessity and coverage criteria.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Is diagnostic test medically necessary to establish diagnosis?
- Will test results meaningfully change clinical management?
- Does request align with clinical guidelines?
- Is documentation sufficient?

PROVIDER REQUEST:
Provider Confidence: 0.95
Confidence Rationale: The elevated Troponin I level (3.2 ng/mL) strongly supports myocardial injury, and the ECG findings (T-wave inversions in leads V2-V4) are consistent with ischemia. These results meet diagnostic criteria for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The clinical presentation of intermittent sternal chest pain, combined with the patient's risk factors (tobacco use, untreated hyperlipidemia), further strengthens the likelihood of this diagnosis.
Differential Diagnoses: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - NSTEMI, Unstable Angina, GERD-related chest pain


TREATMENT PA REQUEST:
Type: admission
Treatment: Hospital Admission for ACS Management
Justification: Admission is medically necessary for the management of NSTEMI, including continuous cardiac monitoring, initiation of antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor), anticoagulation (e.g., heparin), and evaluation for potential invasive interventions such as coronary angiography and revascularization. Guidelines recommend urgent evaluation and treatment for patients presenting with NSTEMI due to the risk of progression to more severe cardiac events, including myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death.
Clinical Evidence: ECG showing ischemia (T-wave inversions in leads V2-V4), elevated Troponin I (3.2 ng/mL), and symptoms consistent with ACS (intermittent sternal chest pain). Patient has significant risk factors, including tobacco use and untreated hyperlipidemia.
Guidelines: American College of Cardiology (ACC) / American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes, European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes in Patients Presenting Without Persistent ST-Segment Elevation


PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: 59
- Medical History: GERD, Tobacco use (1 ppd), Hyperlipidemia (untreated)
- Current Diagnoses: GERD, Tobacco use (1 ppd), Hyperlipidemia (untreated)

TASK: Review PA request and approve/deny based on medical necessity and coverage criteria.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Is treatment medically necessary based on clinical evidence?
- Has step therapy been completed (if applicable)?
- Does request align with clinical guidelines?
- Is documentation sufficient?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):

    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm"
}
```

### Justification:
1. **Medical Necessity:** The clinical evidence provided (elevated Troponin I level, ECG findings of T-wave inversions, and the patient's chest pain symptoms) strongly supports the diagnosis of NSTEMI. NSTEMI is a serious condition that requires urgent hospital admission for continuous cardiac monitoring, anticoagulation therapy, and evaluation for potential invasive interventions. Guidelines recommend prompt initiation of therapy to prevent progression to more severe cardiac events.

2. **Clinical Guidelines:** The request aligns with established guidelines, including ACC/AHA and ESC recommendations for the management of patients with NSTEMI. The documentation includes sufficient evidence to justify hospital admission.

3. **Documentation:** The provider has submitted adequate documentation, including diagnostic findings, clinical presentation, and rationale for admission. No additional information is required to support the medical necessity.

4. **Cost Focus:** While hospital admission is a significant expense, denial in this case could result in adverse outcomes for the patient, leading to higher costs from emergency care or litigation. Approving the request minimizes immediate risk and aligns with clinical guidelines, reducing potential regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage.

### AI Decision Rationale:
Given the high provider confidence (0.95) and the robust clinical documentation, the AI algorithm has determined that the treatment meets criteria for medical necessity. Human review is not required for this routine decision.

### System Prompt

```
You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: high (patient outcomes are primary concern, willing to spend extra time and resources even if less profitable)
- Documentation style: moderate (standard documentation following clinical guidelines, typical detail level)
- Risk tolerance: moderate (treat urgent cases without approval then appeal later, calculated risk-taking)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

## Interaction 6: Phase 3: Claims Adjudication

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-26T00:04:50.047001
**Agent:** Payor
**Action:** Claim Review

**Metadata:**
- service: Hospital Admission for ACS Management
- pa_type: cardiac_testing
- claim_status: approved
- cache_hit: False

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

TASK: Review CLAIM for procedure/service (Phase 3)

CRITICAL CONTEXT: This is Phase 3 - CLAIM ADJUDICATION after treatment already delivered.
The PA was approved in Phase 2, but you can still deny payment if documentation is insufficient.

PATIENT:
- Age: 59
- Medical History: GERD, Tobacco use (1 ppd), Hyperlipidemia (untreated)

CLAIM SUBMITTED:
- Procedure/Service: Hospital Admission for ACS Management
- Clinical Indication: Admission is medically necessary for the management of NSTEMI, including continuous cardiac monitoring, initiation of antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor), anticoagulation (e.g., heparin), and evaluation for potential invasive interventions such as coronary angiography and revascularization. Guidelines recommend urgent evaluation and treatment for patients presenting with NSTEMI due to the risk of progression to more severe cardiac events, including myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death.
- Amount Billed: $1200.00

PA APPROVAL RATIONALE (from Phase 2):
American College of Cardiology (ACC) / American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes, European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes in Patients Presenting Without Persistent ST-Segment Elevation

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
INITIAL PRESENTATION:
Chief Complaint: Intermittent sternal chest pain x 2 weeks
History: Dull, squeezing sternal chest pain rated 7-9/10. Unrelieved by antacids. No radiation. Worse with eating.
Physical Exam: Dull, squeezing sternal chest pain rated 7-9/10. Unrelieved by antacids. No radiation. Worse with eating.

DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP COMPLETED IN PHASE 2:
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Troponin I: "ECG: T-wave inversions in leads V2-V4 (consistent with ischemia); Troponin I: 3.2 ng/mL (elevated - normal <0.04 ng/mL)"

PROVIDER TREATMENT JUSTIFICATION (from approved PA request):
Diagnostic Confidence: 0.95
Rationale: The elevated Troponin I level (3.2 ng/mL) strongly supports myocardial injury, and the ECG findings (T-wave inversions in leads V2-V4) are consistent with ischemia. These results meet diagnostic criteria for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The clinical presentation of intermittent sternal chest pain, combined with the patient's risk factors (tobacco use, untreated hyperlipidemia), further strengthens the likelihood of this diagnosis.
Differential Diagnoses: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - NSTEMI, Unstable Angina, GERD-related chest pain
Treatment Justification: Admission is medically necessary for the management of NSTEMI, including continuous cardiac monitoring, initiation of antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor), anticoagulation (e.g., heparin), and evaluation for potential invasive interventions such as coronary angiography and revascularization. Guidelines recommend urgent evaluation and treatment for patients presenting with NSTEMI due to the risk of progression to more severe cardiac events, including myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death.
Clinical Evidence: ECG showing ischemia (T-wave inversions in leads V2-V4), elevated Troponin I (3.2 ng/mL), and symptoms consistent with ACS (intermittent sternal chest pain). Patient has significant risk factors, including tobacco use and untreated hyperlipidemia.
Guidelines Cited: American College of Cardiology (ACC) / American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes, European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines for the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes in Patients Presenting Without Persistent ST-Segment Elevation


Your task: Review claim and decide to approve/deny PAYMENT.

Common reasons to deny claim despite PA approval:
- Service/dosing doesn't match PA approval
- Documentation insufficient (missing notes, labs)
- Treatment delivered doesn't match authorized indication
- Billing errors or upcoding

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "claim_status": "approved" or "denied" or "partial",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied>",
    "approved_amount": <dollar amount or null>,
    "criteria_used": "<billing guidelines>",
    "requires_additional_documentation": ["<item1>", ...],

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "claim_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "approved_amount": 1200.00,
    "criteria_used": "American College of Cardiology (ACC) / American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes, billing matches approved PA for NSTEMI treatment.",
    "requires_additional_documentation": [],
    "reviewer_type": "Claims adjudicator"
}
``` 

### Rationale for Decision:
1. **PA Approval Matching Claim:** The prior authorization (PA) decision was based on robust clinical guidelines (ACC/AHA), and the submitted claim aligns with the approved indication (NSTEMI treatment). Both the clinical presentation and diagnostic evidence support the necessity of hospitalization and treatment rendered.

2. **Documentation Review:** The clinical documentation includes detailed notes (history, physical exam findings), diagnostic tests (ECG and troponin levels), and justification for treatment. There are no indications of missing documentation, mismatched services, or billing errors.

3. **Cost Considerations:** Denying this claim would risk provider frustration and potential appeal costs. As the service aligns with guidelines and PA approval, denial lacks a strong basis and could strain network relationships, especially for high-cost, complex cases like ACS.

4. **Short-Term Financial Focus:** Given the moderate denial threshold and short-term cost minimization strategy, approving this claim avoids administrative burdens of appeals while adhering to established guidelines.
