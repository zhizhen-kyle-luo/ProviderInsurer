### System Prompt

```
You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: high (patient outcomes are primary concern, willing to spend extra time and resources even if less profitable)
- Documentation style: moderate (standard documentation following clinical guidelines, typical detail level)
- Risk tolerance: moderate (treat urgent cases without approval then appeal later, calculated risk-taking)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

**Action:** Diagnostic Test Review

**Metadata:**
- iteration: 1

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

### Explanation:
- **Confidence Level (0.85):** The diagnostic confidence is high but not definitive, as the normal LVEF and lack of significant diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram suggest that CHF is not the sole contributor to symptoms. However, the exact cause of respiratory failure and fluid overload is still unclear.
- **Differential Diagnoses:** Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure due to sleep apnea, volume overload from CHF, pulmonary hypertension, or renal dysfunction are all plausible contributors.
- **Next Action:** Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) are requested to clarify the role of respiratory dysfunction in the patient's presentation. The results will guide further management, particularly in differentiating between obstructive versus restrictive lung disease or other causes.

- Patient care priority: high (patient outcomes are primary concern, willing to spend extra time and resources even if less profitable)
- Documentation style: moderate (standard documentation following clinical guidelines, typical detail level)
- Risk tolerance: moderate (treat urgent cases without approval then appeal later, calculated risk-taking)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

ITERATION 3/10


CONFIDENCE SCORE (0.0-1.0):
represents your diagnostic certainty for proposing treatment

0.0-0.3: very uncertain diagnosis
  - need basic diagnostic workup (CBC, basic metabolic panel, vital signs)
  - multiple differentials remain plausible
  - insufficient data to narrow diagnosis

0.3-0.6: working diagnosis forming
  - initial test results available
  - narrowing differential based on objective findings
  - need confirmatory testing to establish diagnosis

0.6-0.9: strong clinical suspicion
  - key diagnostic criteria met
  - may need confirmatory testing (imaging, biopsy, specialized labs)
  - high probability of specific diagnosis but not definitive

0.9-1.0: confident diagnosis
  - diagnostic criteria satisfied per clinical guidelines
  - objective evidence supports diagnosis
  - ready to propose definitive treatment
  - evidence sufficient for treatment PA request

DECISION LOGIC:
- if confidence < 0.9: request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- if confidence >= 0.9: request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

IMPORTANT: generate your own confidence score based on available clinical data


PRIOR ITERATIONS:

Iteration 1:

ITERATION 3/10

PROVIDER REQUEST:
Provider Confidence: 0.95
Confidence Rationale: The diagnostic data strongly supports the presence of respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or restrictive lung disease, compounded by acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) show severely reduced FEV1 and moderately reduced DLCO, indicating impaired gas exchange and obstructive patterns. Concurrently, CHF and nocturnal BiPAP dependency suggest significant cardiopulmonary compromise. LVEF and diastolic function are normal, ruling out worsening systolic heart failure. Based on this, the diagnosis is clear, and treatment is required to address chronic oxygen needs and fluid overload.
Differential Diagnoses: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Restrictive Lung Disease, Acute-on-Chronic Respiratory Failure, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)


TREATMENT PA REQUEST:
Type: admission
Treatment: Hospital admission for acute-on-chronic respiratory failure management
Justification: The patient presents with chronic oxygen therapy requirements, nocturnal BiPAP dependency, and fluid overload, consistent with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. Hospital admission is necessary to stabilize respiratory function, optimize oxygen therapy, manage fluid overload, and monitor for complications such as worsening hypoxia or hypercapnia. Current outpatient management is insufficient given the severity of symptoms and need for close monitoring.
Clinical Evidence: {'Chest X-ray, Echocardiogram, BNP levels': 'Normal LVEF and no significant diastolic dysfunction rule out worsening systolic heart failure.', 'Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)': 'Severely reduced FEV1, moderately reduced FVC, normal FEV1/FVC ratio, and reduced DLCO confirm obstructive and gas exchange abnormalities.', 'Patient symptoms': 'Chronic oxygen therapy (4 LPM), nocturnal BiPAP dependency, and fluid overload indicate severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction requiring inpatient care.'}
Guidelines: Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for COPD management, American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for acute respiratory failure, American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines for CHF management


PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: 59
- Medical History: Acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Sleep Apnea, Diabetes Mellitus
- Current Diagnoses: Acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Sleep Apnea, Diabetes Mellitus

TASK: Review PA request and approve/deny based on medical necessity and coverage criteria.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Is treatment medically necessary based on clinical evidence?
- Has step therapy been completed (if applicable)?
- Does request align with clinical guidelines?
- Is documentation sufficient?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "authorization_status": "approved" or "denied",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied, including what's missing or why unnecessary>",
    "criteria_used": "<guidelines or policies applied>",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm" or "Nurse reviewer" or "Medical director"

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "authorization_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "criteria_used": "Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for COPD management, American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for acute respiratory failure, and American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines for CHF management.

    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm"
}
``` 

### Rationale:
1. **Medical Necessity:** The clinical evidence provided (PFTs, patient symptoms, diagnostic tests) strongly supports the need for hospital admission to manage acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. Current outpatient care is insufficient given the severity of the patient's condition.
   
2. **Guideline Alignment:** The request aligns with established clinical guidelines, including GOLD, ATS, and ACC recommendations for managing COPD, acute respiratory failure, and CHF. Acute-on-chronic respiratory failure is a recognized medical emergency requiring inpatient care.

3. **Documentation Sufficiency:** The provider has supplied adequate diagnostic data (PFTs, imaging, lab results) and a detailed clinical picture to justify hospital admission. No gaps in documentation or alternative treatments were identified.

4. **Cost-Benefit Consideration:** While hospital admissions are expensive, denying this request could lead to worse outcomes (e.g., worsening respiratory failure, readmissions, or appeals), which would increase administrative costs and jeopardize network stability.

By approving this request, immediate stabilization of the patient's condition is prioritized, reducing the risk of complications and costly future interventions.

Chief Complaint: Chronic oxygen therapy needs (4 LPM), nocturnal BiPAP dependency, fluid overload
History: Chronic oxygen therapy needs (4 LPM), nocturnal BiPAP dependency, fluid overload

DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP COMPLETED IN PHASE 2:
- Chest X-ray, BNP levels, and Echocardiogram: LVEF 55% (Normal), no significant diastolic dysfunction
- Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs): "FEV1: 0.85 L (severely reduced - normal >1.5 L for age/sex), FVC: 1.20 L (moderately reduced - normal >2.0 L for age/sex), FEV1/FVC: 71% (normal - normal ≥70%), DLCO: 8.5 mL/min/mmHg (moderately reduced - normal >20 mL/min/mmHg)"

PROVIDER TREATMENT JUSTIFICATION (from approved PA request):
Diagnostic Confidence: 0.95
Rationale: The diagnostic data strongly supports the presence of respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or restrictive lung disease, compounded by acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) show severely reduced FEV1 and moderately reduced DLCO, indicating impaired gas exchange and obstructive patterns. Concurrently, CHF and nocturnal BiPAP dependency suggest significant cardiopulmonary compromise. LVEF and diastolic function are normal, ruling out worsening systolic heart failure. Based on this, the diagnosis is clear, and treatment is required to address chronic oxygen needs and fluid overload.
Differential Diagnoses: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Restrictive Lung Disease, Acute-on-Chronic Respiratory Failure, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
Treatment Justification: The patient presents with chronic oxygen therapy requirements, nocturnal BiPAP dependency, and fluid overload, consistent with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. Hospital admission is necessary to stabilize respiratory function, optimize oxygen therapy, manage fluid overload, and monitor for complications such as worsening hypoxia or hypercapnia. Current outpatient management is insufficient given the severity of symptoms and need for close monitoring.
Clinical Evidence: {'Chest X-ray, Echocardiogram, BNP levels': 'Normal LVEF and no significant diastolic dysfunction rule out worsening systolic heart failure.', 'Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)': 'Severely reduced FEV1, moderately reduced FVC, normal FEV1/FVC ratio, and reduced DLCO confirm obstructive and gas exchange abnormalities.', 'Patient symptoms': 'Chronic oxygen therapy (4 LPM), nocturnal BiPAP dependency, and fluid overload indicate severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction requiring inpatient care.'}
Guidelines Cited: Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for COPD management, American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for acute respiratory failure, American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines for CHF management


Your task: Review claim and decide to approve/deny PAYMENT.

Common reasons to deny claim despite PA approval:
- Service/dosing doesn't match PA approval
- Documentation insufficient (missing notes, labs)
- Treatment delivered doesn't match authorized indication
- Billing errors or upcoding

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "claim_status": "approved" or "denied" or "partial",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied>",
    "approved_amount": <dollar amount or null>,
    "criteria_used": "<billing guidelines>",
    "requires_additional_documentation": ["<item1>", ...],

### LLM Response

```
```json
{
    "claim_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "approved_amount": 7800.00,
    "criteria_used": "Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for COPD management, American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for acute respiratory failure, American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines for CHF management; documentation matches prior authorization and clinical indications.",
    "requires_additional_documentation": [],
    "reviewer_type": "Claims adjudicator"
}
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **Service Matches Prior Authorization**: The hospital admission aligns with the approved prior authorization rationale and medically necessary indications. Diagnostic tests and treatments match the clinical scenario outlined in Phase 2.

2. **Sufficient Documentation**: Clinical documentation clearly supports the need for inpatient care, citing diagnostic results (PFTs, BNP, echocardiogram, chest X-ray) and guideline-based recommendations.

3. **Billing Accuracy**: No evidence of billing errors, upcoding, or discrepancies between the service provided and the clinical justification.

4. **Cost Focus**: While approving the claim incurs immediate costs, denying it would likely lead to appeals and administrative burdens due to the strong clinical justification and prior authorization approval. Additionally, denying valid claims risks provider dissatisfaction and regulatory scrutiny.

5. **AI Reliance**: The AI system flagged no issues with coding, documentation, or medical necessity, and a human review is unnecessary in this case.
