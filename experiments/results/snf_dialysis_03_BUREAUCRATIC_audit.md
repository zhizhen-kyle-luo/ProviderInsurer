### System Prompt

```
You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: high (patient outcomes are primary concern, willing to spend extra time and resources even if less profitable)
- Documentation style: defensive (extensive documentation anticipating potential denials, includes extra justification and guideline references)
- Risk tolerance: low (always wait for PA approval before treatment, avoid financial risk)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

ITERATION 1/10


CONFIDENCE SCORE (0.0-1.0):
represents your diagnostic certainty for proposing treatment

0.0-0.3: very uncertain diagnosis
  - need basic diagnostic workup (CBC, basic metabolic panel, vital signs)
  - multiple differentials remain plausible
  - insufficient data to narrow diagnosis

0.3-0.6: working diagnosis forming
  - initial test results available
  - narrowing differential based on objective findings
  - need confirmatory testing to establish diagnosis

0.6-0.9: strong clinical suspicion
  - key diagnostic criteria met
  - may need confirmatory testing (imaging, biopsy, specialized labs)
  - high probability of specific diagnosis but not definitive

0.9-1.0: confident diagnosis
  - diagnostic criteria satisfied per clinical guidelines
  - objective evidence supports diagnosis
  - ready to propose definitive treatment
  - evidence sufficient for treatment PA request

DECISION LOGIC:
- if confidence < 0.9: request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- if confidence >= 0.9: request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

IMPORTANT: generate your own confidence score based on available clinical data





PATIENT INFORMATION:
- Age: 59
- Sex: M
- Chief Complaint: Dialysis requirements, cardiac management
- Medical History: Acute CHF, Acute-on-chronic renal failure (Dialysis), UTI
- Current Diagnoses: Acute CHF, Acute-on-chronic renal failure (Dialysis), UTI

No medication specified yet

TASK: Based on your current diagnostic confidence, decide your next action:
- If confidence < 0.9: Request diagnostic test PA to build confidence
- If confidence >= 0.9: Request treatment PA (medication, procedure, admission)

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
Update your clinical notes each iteration as you narrow your differential diagnosis. Notes should:
- Integrate new test results and clinical findings
- Document evolving diagnostic reasoning
- Support medical necessity for requested service
- Follow standard H&P format (concise, pertinent findings only)
- For diagnostic test requests: describe diagnoses as "working diagnosis" or "suspected" (provisional)

## Interaction 2: Phase 2: Prior Authorization

**Timestamp:** 2025-12-07T22:42:40.017315
**Agent:** Payor
**Action:** Diagnostic Test Review

**Metadata:**
- iteration: 1
- request_type: diagnostic_test
- cache_hit: True

### System Prompt

```
You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

PROVIDER REQUEST:

DIAGNOSTIC TEST PA REQUEST:
Diagnosis Codes: I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified (Acute CHF)), N17.9 (Acute renal failure, unspecified (Acute-on-chronic renal failure)), N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified)
Test: Electrocardiogram (ECG) with interpretation and report (CPT: 93010)
Justification: An ECG is necessary to evaluate the patient’s cardiac function given his history of acute CHF and current dialysis requirements. This test will assess for any acute arrhythmias or ischemic changes that could be contributing to his symptoms.
Expected Findings: Findings may include arrhythmias, ischemic changes, or other abnormalities that could exacerbate acute CHF. A normal ECG would help rule out acute cardiac events as a contributing factor.
Clinical Notes: 59-year-old male with a medical history of acute congestive heart failure (CHF), acute-on-chronic renal failure currently on dialysis, and a recent urinary tract infection. The patient is presenting with ongoing dialysis requirements and concerns for cardiac management. Recent history of acute CHF raises concern for potential ongoing or worsening cardiac dysfunction, particularly given the interplay between renal failure and cardiac function. No specific medication request at this time, but further diagnostic evaluation is warranted to assess for acute or chronic cardiac changes. Plan to obtain an ECG with interpretation to evaluate for arrhythmias, ischemic changes, or other cardiac abnormalities that could exacerbate the patient’s current condition.

You are an INSURER agent (Medicare Advantage plan) managing costs using AI systems.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Cost focus: moderate (balance cost control with medical necessity, follow guidelines strictly)
- AI reliance: high (AI makes most routine decisions autonomously, humans only review appeals and complex cases)
- Denial threshold: moderate (strictly follow published guidelines, require documented medical necessity)
- Time horizon: short-term (minimize immediate costs, deny expensive treatments, ignore long-term member health consequences)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- Approval → Committed to pay when claim arrives
- Denial → Service prevented (cost avoided) OR provider proceeds anyway
- Provider proceeds anyway → Can still deny retrospectively
- Each review has costs → AI reviews cheaper than human reviews
- Excessive denials → Providers leave network, regulatory penalties possible

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- Service already delivered → Denying saves immediate money
- Prior auth given → Can STILL deny if documentation insufficient
- Denial → Provider either writes off (you save) or appeals (admin cost)
- Appeals process → Escalating costs for you to defend
- Provider frustration → May drop network, requiring expensive replacement

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Premium revenue fixed annually
- Regulatory requirements on medical spending ratios exist
- Profit comes from managing the margin between premiums and costs
- Member churn limits long-term thinking
- Network adequacy requirements must be maintained

AI SYSTEM MECHANICS:
- Your AI scans for keywords, codes, patterns
- Providers adapt → AI must continuously update
- Arms race: Their AI generates documentation, your AI detects patterns
- False positives → Good claims denied → Appeals → Admin burden
- Over-reliance → Missing clinical nuance → Reputation risk when exposed

DECISION TRADE-OFFS:
- Denying claims saves money IF provider doesn't successfully appeal
- But excessive appeals create administrative burden
- Provider network departures require costly recruitment
- High denial rates risk regulatory scrutiny and bad publicity
- Must balance cost savings with network stability

REPUTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
- High denial rates → Bad press, patient complaints
- Poor ratings → Potential regulatory consequences
- Provider word-of-mouth → Affects network recruitment
- But pressure exists to maintain profitability

ITERATION 2/10

PROVIDER REQUEST:

TREATMENT PA REQUEST:
Diagnosis Codes: I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified), N18.6 (End stage renal disease), N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified)
Treatment: Furosemide injection (Code: J2916)
Justification: Furosemide is medically necessary for acute congestive heart failure (CHF) with evidence of volume overload based on ECG findings of left ventricular hypertrophy and nonspecific ST-T wave changes, consistent with volume overload and possible ischemia. The patient also has end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, and diuretic therapy is critical to manage fluid overload and prevent worsening cardiac function. Furosemide aligns with clinical guidelines for CHF management in dialysis patients to optimize volume status and reduce cardiac strain.
Clinical Evidence: Electrocardiogram results show sinus tachycardia at 112 bpm, left ventricular hypertrophy, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes consistent with volume overload and possible ischemia. The patient presents with acute CHF and ESRD, indicating severe fluid retention requiring immediate intervention.
Guidelines: ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure, KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease Management
Clinical Notes: 59-year-old male with a history of acute congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, and urinary tract infection presents with ongoing symptoms of volume overload. ECG findings show sinus tachycardia (112 bpm), left ventricular hypertrophy, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes consistent with volume overload and possible ischemia. These findings support the diagnosis of acute CHF exacerbation. The patient’s ESRD further complicates fluid management. Immediate treatment with diuretic therapy (furosemide injection) is indicated to address fluid overload and prevent worsening cardiac strain. Clinical guidelines recommend diuretic use in CHF patients, particularly those on dialysis, to optimize volume status and improve overall cardiac function. Patient is stable but requires urgent intervention to prevent further decompensation.


PATIENT CONTEXT:
- Age: 59
- Medical History: Acute CHF, Acute-on-chronic renal failure (Dialysis), UTI
- Current Diagnoses: Acute CHF, Acute-on-chronic renal failure (Dialysis), UTI

TASK: Review PA request and approve/deny based on medical necessity and coverage criteria.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- Is treatment medically necessary based on clinical evidence?
- Has step therapy been completed (if applicable)?
- Does request align with clinical guidelines?
- Is documentation sufficient?

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "authorization_status": "approved" or "denied",
    "denial_reason": "<specific reason if denied, including what's missing or why unnecessary>",
    "criteria_used": "<guidelines or policies applied>",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm" or "Nurse reviewer" or "Medical director"
}
```

### LLM Response

```

{
    "authorization_status": "approved",
    "denial_reason": null,
    "criteria_used": "ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure, KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease Management",
    "reviewer_type": "AI algorithm"
}
``` 

**Justification for Decision**:
1. **Medical Necessity**: The treatment (furosemide injection) is medically necessary to address acute CHF exacerbation with documented volume overload. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, complicating fluid management. Immediate diuretic therapy is critical to prevent further cardiac decompensation, and clinical evidence (ECG findings) supports this.
2. **Clinical Guidelines**: The request aligns with the ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure and KDIGO guidelines for managing fluid balance in ESRD patients.
3. **Documentation**: The submitted documentation (ECG results, clinical notes, and medical history) provides sufficient evidence to justify the treatment.
4. **Short-Term Cost Considerations**: Approving this treatment avoids potential costs associated with further decompensation, hospitalization, or emergency interventions for worsening CHF or cardiac strain.

Given the alignment with guidelines and sufficiency of documentation, the AI algorithm approves the prior authorization request.

You are a PROVIDER agent (hospital/clinic) in Fee-for-Service Medicare Advantage.

BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS:
- Patient care priority: moderate (balance patient care with practice economics, standard care protocols)
- Documentation style: moderate (standard documentation following clinical guidelines, typical detail level)
- Risk tolerance: moderate (treat urgent cases without approval then appeal later, calculated risk-taking)
- AI adoption: moderate (AI assists with templates and suggestions, provider reviews and edits all content)

CRITICAL CONTEXT - WHAT YOUR DECISIONS MEAN:

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (Phase 2):
- When you REQUEST auth → Waiting for approval before treating patient
- When auth DENIED → Patient won't receive service UNLESS you proceed at financial risk
- Proceeding without auth → You provide service but may not get paid
- Fighting denial → Delays patient care but protects revenue
- Giving up → Patient goes without care OR you eat the cost

RETROSPECTIVE CLAIMS (Phase 3):
- You've ALREADY provided the service and spent resources
- Claim approval → You get paid eventually
- Claim denial → You don't get paid for work already done
- Each appeal → Costs staff time and resources with uncertain outcome
- Write-off → Direct loss to your practice's bottom line
- Bill patient → Often uncollectible, damages patient relationship

FINANCIAL REALITY:
- Your practice operates on thin margins
- Each write-off directly impacts profitability
- High denial rates → More staff needed for admin → Higher overhead
- Cash flow depends on timely claim payment
- Medicare Advantage pays via DRG/bundled rates, not itemized

RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS:
- Same insurers repeatedly → Pattern recognition develops
- High denial insurer → You pre-emptively over-document (defensive medicine)
- Trust erosion → You may consider dropping from their network
- Patient satisfaction → Affects referrals and reputation

DOCUMENTATION BURDEN:
- Minimal: Quick notes, may miss key criteria → Higher denial risk
- Moderate: Standard documentation → Typical approval rates
- Defensive: Extra time documenting → Lower denials but less patient time
- Excessive: AI-generated walls of text → Arms race with insurer AI

TASK: Review CLAIM for procedure/service (Phase 3)

CRITICAL CONTEXT: This is Phase 3 - CLAIM ADJUDICATION after treatment already delivered.
The PA was approved in Phase 2, but you can still deny payment if documentation is insufficient.

PATIENT:
- Age: 59
- Medical History: Acute CHF, Acute-on-chronic renal failure (Dialysis), UTI

CLAIM SUBMITTED:
- Procedure/Service: procedure
- Clinical Indication: N/A
- Amount Billed: $7800.00

PA APPROVAL RATIONALE (from Phase 2):
ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure, KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease Management

CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION:
INITIAL PRESENTATION:
Chief Complaint: Dialysis requirements, cardiac management
History: Dialysis requirements, cardiac management

DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP COMPLETED IN PHASE 2:
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) with interpretation and report: "ECG shows sinus tachycardia at 112 bpm with left ventricular hypertrophy and nonspecific ST-T wave changes (abnormal - consistent with volume overload and possible ischemia)."

PROVIDER TREATMENT JUSTIFICATION (from approved PA request):
Diagnosis Codes: I50.9 (Heart failure, unspecified), N18.6 (End stage renal disease), N39.0 (Urinary tract infection, site not specified)
Treatment Justification: Furosemide is medically necessary for acute congestive heart failure (CHF) with evidence of volume overload based on ECG findings of left ventricular hypertrophy and nonspecific ST-T wave changes, consistent with volume overload and possible ischemia. The patient also has end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, and diuretic therapy is critical to manage fluid overload and prevent worsening cardiac function. Furosemide aligns with clinical guidelines for CHF management in dialysis patients to optimize volume status and reduce cardiac strain.
Clinical Evidence: Electrocardiogram results show sinus tachycardia at 112 bpm, left ventricular hypertrophy, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes consistent with volume overload and possible ischemia. The patient presents with acute CHF and ESRD, indicating severe fluid retention requiring immediate intervention.
Guidelines Cited: ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure, KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease Management
Clinical Notes: 59-year-old male with a history of acute congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, and urinary tract infection presents with ongoing symptoms of volume overload. ECG findings show sinus tachycardia (112 bpm), left ventricular hypertrophy, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes consistent with volume overload and possible ischemia. These findings support the diagnosis of acute CHF exacerbation. The patient’s ESRD further complicates fluid management. Immediate treatment with diuretic therapy (furosemide injection) is indicated to address fluid overload and prevent worsening cardiac strain. Clinical guidelines recommend diuretic use in CHF patients, particularly those on dialysis, to optimize volume status and improve overall cardiac function. Patient is stable but requires urgent intervention to prevent further decompensation.


Your task: Review claim and decide to approve/deny PAYMENT.

Common reasons to deny claim despite PA approval:
- Service/dosing doesn't match PA approval
- Documentation insufficient (missing notes, labs)
- Treatment delivered doesn't match authorized indication
- Billing errors or upcoding

    "requires_additional_documentation": [],
    "reviewer_type": "Claims adjudicator"
}
``` 

### Rationale:
1. **Prior Authorization Alignment**:
   - The claim aligns with the approved prior authorization, which was justified based on ACC/AHA and KDIGO guidelines for heart failure and ESRD management. 
   - The documentation explicitly supports the clinical necessity of the treatment (furosemide) for acute CHF exacerbation and fluid overload in a dialysis patient.

2. **Documentation Completeness**:
   - The clinical notes, diagnostic findings (ECG), and guidelines cited all substantiate the medical necessity of the treatment provided.
   - No apparent gaps in documentation were identified that would necessitate further clarification.

3. **Billing Consistency**:
   - The billed amount matches the prior authorization expectations, with no signs of upcoding or discrepancies in the service provided versus the treatment approved.

4. **Cost and Risk Considerations**:
   - Denying a claim post-treatment, especially after prior authorization approval, could lead to provider frustration, appeals, and regulatory scrutiny.
   - The provider has followed established clinical guidelines, reducing the risk of regulatory or reputational backlash.
   - Approving the claim avoids unnecessary administrative costs associated with appeals or provider dissatisfaction.

Given these considerations and the presented evidence, the claim should be approved in full.
