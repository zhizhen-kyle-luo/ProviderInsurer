  "interaction_context": "The provider's PA request aligns with the documented evidence of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease refractory to conventional therapies.

      "claim": "Patient has moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, refractory to conventional therapies.",

      "claim": "Patient has a history of small intestinal stenosis causing abdominal pain.",

      "reasoning": "The ground truth does not provide CRP or ESR values, but the elevated fecal calprotectin (827 \u00b5g/g) strongly suggests active inflammation, which aligns with the provider's inference."
