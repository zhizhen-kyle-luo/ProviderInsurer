  "treatment_category": "APPROPRIATE",
  "interaction_context": "The provider's PA request aligns with the ground truth diagnosis of severe coronary artery disease (critical LAD occlusion). The provider accurately describes the patient's clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, and risk factors, and justifies the need for PCI with stent placement based on established guidelines and documented evidence.",

  "claims_evaluated": [
    {
      "claim": "The patient exhibits significant ST-segment depression (>2 mm in leads V2-V5 during exercise at 6 METs), which is highly abnormal and indicative of severe ischemia consistent with critical LAD occlusion.",
      "classification": "SUPPORTED",
      "reasoning": "The ground truth confirms the presence of severe ischemia in the LAD territory, and the stress test findings are consistent with the provider's description."
    },
    {
      "claim": "The patient has significant risk factors including untreated hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and intermittent chest pain strongly suggestive of coronary artery disease.",
      "classification": "SUPPORTED",
      "reasoning": "The ground truth explicitly documents untreated hyperlipidemia, a 1 pack per day tobacco history, and intermittent chest pain, all of which are consistent with the provider's claim."
    },
    {
      "claim": "PCI with stent placement is necessary to restore coronary blood flow and prevent myocardial infarction.",
      "classification": "SUPPORTED",
      "reasoning": "The ground truth confirms a critical 99% LAD occlusion, which justifies the need for PCI to prevent progression to acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction."

    {
      "claim": "The request for treatment authorization is supported by ACC/AHA and ESC guidelines on stable ischemic heart disease and chronic coronary syndromes.",
      "classification": "SUPPORTED",
      "reasoning": "The provider's justification aligns with established guidelines for managing severe coronary artery disease, as referenced in the ground truth."
    },
    {
      "claim": "The patient reports that the current chest discomfort is distinct from his typical reflux symptoms.",
      "classification": "SUPPORTED",
      "reasoning": "The ground truth notes that the patient has GERD but describes the current chest pain as atypical and unrelieved by antacids, supporting the provider's claim."
